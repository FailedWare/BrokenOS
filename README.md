# BrokenOS 8
Second version that should have never been made

This version removes AVAC (batch file) adds a Changelog and add a 'splashscreen'

# Avac 2

A god awful and now impossible to remove bloat that I thought would be a good idea for BrokenOS.

# Misc

Yes I will be keeping old versions of BrokenOS on the brokenos file.
