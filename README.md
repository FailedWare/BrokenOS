# BrokenOS 7
First version I posted onto GitHub.

This version updates BrokenOS itself and AVAC also includes a little useless scriptbox if you type in avac(bos7)

I was also forced to remove a few files, if BrokenOS brings up these file names send stuff in issues I guess.

# Avac 2

Avac is a little project im adding slowly into BrokenOS I guess the best way to explain it is its just linux's 'sudo' but more shitty and less bloated.

Start every avac script with 'avac()'

# Read if you dont use Windows systems.

Look I hate to break that you cant run batch files on a Linux or an MacOS. I have zero clue if stuff like Wine can run batch files (despite the fact I use a Linux VM on my freetime).
